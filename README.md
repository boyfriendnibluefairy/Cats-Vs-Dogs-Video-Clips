This demo app presents how a video player is implemented in SwiftUI.

### FEATURES:
* Utlizes Apple's AVKit that allows us to easily add media player in our app.
* Demonstrates how to call REST API
* Decode JSON data, fetched from Pexel API, using the load function
* Save JSON data to our SwiftUI Model

The structure is largely based on Stephanie Diep's workflow.
